# Markov Chains
This project implements a markov chain that models infection rate for an epidemic.<br />
There are three fictional lunar colonies and given is a probability vector for day 0<br />
infection rates for the colonies as well as a transition matrix A to define the transitions<br />
along the markov chain.
